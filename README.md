# Spyshifting

This game was developed for Ludum Dare 35 Jam by morg and ivucica.

- We're using the [Godot engine](http://www.godotengine.org/).
- Livestream was at: http://twitch.tv/ivucica
- There will be a build at http://badc0de.net/ld35/.

## Background

You are a spy crawling around a research center. The place is crawling
with guards. Luckily, you've been equipped with nanotechnology that
lets you perfectly imitate another person's appearance... but only for a
short piece of time.

Can you get through the research center undetected?

## How to play

- Use cursor keys to move around.
- Reach exit to go to the next level.
- Don't get caught inside a guard's cone of vision.
- Guard's cone of vision does not *actually* extend behind a wall;
  use walls to hide.
- Approach a guard to less-than-a-tile of distance and hit space to
  shapeshift.
- Guards won't be upset if you have the same color as them. Use
  shapeshifting to trick them into letting you through.

There's 14 levels of fun. Enjoy!

## Known issues

- Web version is rather slow on Chrome.
- In some situations, mouse input may not work in the web version. (We
  tried to supply keyboard input for some of these situations.)
